This is a virtual bullet journal that allows the user to create their daily tasks for the day and can switch between multiple tabs. These multiple tabs are what contain the weekly tasks, monthly important dates, and any future planning that the user might have. So the user can plan out their week, input any important dates they would like to keep track of, and any goals they have for the future as well.
